### Default behavior
sciber-yklocker will check if there is a YubiKey present every 10 seconds. If no command-line arguments / registry values instruments the application to lock the computer it will do nothing.


## Installation
### Windows
1. Download the installer sciber-yklocker.msi from [releases](https://github.com/sciber-io/yklocker/releases)
2. Run the installer (installs the service SciberYklocker for you)
#### Set registry values
1. Download the .admx and .adml files from the "Administrative template" folder
2. Intune/GPO: Follow Jonas guide on his blog: https://swjm.blog/locking-the-workstation-on-fido2-security-key-removal-part-2-80962c944c78 to set up GPO/Intune control to decide what you want to do if the YubiKey is removed.
3. (Locally: download the amdx and adml file to your computer and place them in C:\Windows\PolicyDefinitions, then start local group policy editor -> Computer Configuration -> Administrative Templates -> Sciber Yklocker Settings --> turn on to get registry values)
